   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to klang's documentation!
=================================

Klang is no different than Kaleidoscope introduced in `LLVM Tutorial <http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/>`_. It is just one of Kaleidoscope.
But Klang is being reconstructured to be similar to Clang! Doing this provides fun and a lot of motivation to study LLVM and Clang. As you know Kaleidoscope is implemented in toy.cpp. Klang is another toy!

And there might appear Klang++. Klang++ will have advanced features like non-JIT compile, compiling file-based code, etc. Klang and Klang++ will share common source files. This will resemble clang and clang++.
